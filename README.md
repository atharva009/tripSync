# Project Summary for TripSync
**Project Overview:**
TripSync is an intuitive and centralized travel itinerary management platform designed to address the complexities of planning and managing travel. The platform simplifies travel planning by providing users with tools to organize trips, track activities, and manage accommodations efficiently. By combining a clean user interface with robust backend functionality, TripSync aims to offer a seamless travel experience, saving users time and effort in organizing their itineraries.


**Key challenges addressed include:**
1. Centralizing trip data such as costs, schedules, and accommodations.
2. Providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for trip components.
3. Enabling advanced filtering to refine and personalize trip management.
4. The platform ensures efficient organization through a user-friendly interface and backend support, making it an indispensable tool for travelers.

## Features

- User Authentication and Security
- Trip Management
- Activity and Accommodation Management
- Dynamic User Interface
- Local Storage Utilization
- Error Handling and Validation
- Filtering and Retrieval


## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React, and TypeScript

**Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA

**Database:** MySQL, Oracle DB

**Build Tool:** Maven





## Object-Oriented Programming Principles

**1. Encapsulation:** Fields in entity classes such as User, Trip, Activity, and Accommodation are private, with controlled access through public getter and setter methods.

**2. Inheritance:** Interfaces such as UserService and TripService ensure consistent structure and enforce a contract for implementation.

**3. Polymorphism:** Service classes override generic methods to include entity-specific logic.

**4. Abstraction:** Layers such as controllers, services, and repositories abstract business logic, enabling modular development.

**5. Composition and Aggregation:** Composition: Trips are composed of Activities and Accommodations as integral components Aggregation: A user can manage multiple trips with independent lifecycles.

**6. Dependency Injection:** Utilizes Springâ€™s DI framework for loose coupling between components like controllers and services.
